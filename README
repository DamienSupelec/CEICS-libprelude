Prelude Library (http://www.prelude-ids.org)
by Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>


Prelude Library Overview
========================

The Prelude Library is used to make sensor developers' life better by 
providing features used by every sensor:

    - Manager(s) Connection management (with fallback in case all 
      configured Managers are down, and automatic reconnection).
    
    - Interface to communicate with the Prelude Manager.
    
    - Asynchronous Message interface (allowing sensor to emmit message 
      without blocking, even if there is latency on the wire).

    - Asynchronous timer interface.

    - Generic configuration API, providing a generic abstraction for 
      command-line, configuration file option, and wide option support.

    - Wide option managment allowing sensor-exported options to be directly 
      accessible from the Manager administrative console.

    - Generic plugin API.




Prelude Communication
=====================

    Prelude IDS uses unique optimized implementation of the XML based IDMEF 
    message format to transmit alerts between the sensors and the manager 
    and between managers.
    
    Using IDMEF, Prelude provides a generic method for virtually any type 
    of sensors to describe precisely the content of an alert.

    Thanks to decoding plugins of the Manager side, a sensor can decide 
    not to use the IDMEF facilities and send information using a customized 
    protocol based on low-level  Prelude Messaging API (note: It is then 
    necessary to provide the correct decoding  plugin on the Manager side). 
    Note that the sensor can also use both methods.
