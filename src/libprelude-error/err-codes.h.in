# Everything up to the first line that starts with a number in the
# first column is copied into the output verbatim.  Then, empty lines
# are ignored.  Other lines must have an error code number, followed
# by one or more <tab> characters, followed by the error code symbol,
# followed by one or more <tab> characters, followed by the error
# message.  Trailing whitespace is removed.  The error codes should be
# sorted.  The last line should not have a number, but only a <tab>,
# followed by a dummy field, followed by a <tab>, followed by a
# description for error codes that are not in the list.
