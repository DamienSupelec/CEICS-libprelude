	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>
	  Fix AC_DATATYPE_GENERIC so that it can find valid socklen_t

	- If we're running on a big endian system, don't send uninitialized
	  64bits value.
	  (Yoann Vandoorselaere).

	- Handle error correctly when processing option from the config
	  file. Assorted cleanup.
	  (Yoann Vandoorselaere)

	- Fix possible file descriptor leak when handling error.

	- Delete plugin entry on plugin loading error. 
	  Fix a possible SIGSEGV.                          (Yoann Vandoorselaere).

	- Fix possible NULL pointer dereference when 
	  searching for a plugin.			   (Yoann Vandoorselaere).
	
	- Remove some unused function			   (Guillaume Pelat).

	- Fix possible recursive loop when asking 
	  information to the user in sensor-adduser.       (Guillaume Pelat).

	- Free username on error when authenticating.      (Guillaume Pelat).
