* 2005-04-09, libprelude-0.9.0-rc3:

	- Change to the plugin infrastructure to check the API version
	  a given plugin was compiled with.

	- Make analyzer deletion work on all architecture.

	- Fix bindings Makefile so that they can be used with BSD make.

	- Stop using pcreposix for IDMEF criteria matching, always rely 
          on POSIX regex. The way pcreposix define it's symbol make it impossible 
          to use it from a library if the final program isn't linked against 
          libpcreposix (example: python / perl program using libprelude bindings).

	- Better incorrect IDMEF criteria detection.

	- Fix some compilation warnings.
	
	- Fix OpenBSD/MacOSX/Irix compilation.

	- Fix compilation on system that lack pthread_atfork().

	- Correct IDMEF value operator check.

	- Better IDMEF criteria error return value.


* 2005-03-31, libprelude-0.9.0-rc2:

	- Fix Python/Perl bindings linking order. Was linking to old version of the library
	  on system where old libprelude-0.8 was installed.

	- Fix an issue with the Perl bindings on make clean.
	

* 2005-03-29, libprelude-0.9.0-rc1:

	Note: due to several years of work and the habit of working with the new 
	version, it is hard to remind all the enhancement made in this release.
	Please bear with us and try it for yourself :-)

	- The Prelude framework has been stabilized, and a lot of consistency work 
	  has been going on.  The C API should remain mostly stable at this point, 
	  and we now offer Python and Perl bindings for interacting with Prelude. 
	  
	- C++ applications should now be able to compile with the library. New and 
	  powerful API like idmef-path (defining a path within an IDMEF message tree, 
	  assigning / retrieving it) and IDMEF criteria filtering has been introduced. 

	- IDMEF draft 14 compliance.
	- Support for IDMEF optionnal integer in events.
	- A lot of work happened with the the IDWG to fix known IDMEF issue.
	- Message routing across distributed Manager for remote sensors administration.

	- The failover subsystem, used when the communication with a Prelude-Manager goes down, 
	  now support transaction and quota.
	
	- Message unique identity generation now done on the sensor side, and fully optional 
	  per IDMEF specifications.

	- Support Ipv6 for client/manager connectivity.

	- Use GnuTLS instead of OpenSSL. Authentication is now always done through TLS, and 
	  the encryption later can be dropped if the connection is local.

	- Usage of a single tool for sensor registration using SRP (Secure Remote Passwor protocol).

	- Allow multiple analyzer instance through the use of profiles.

	- Clean error handling. Application can now check the return value using
	  prelude_perror(), prelude_strerror(), and prelude_strsource().

	- It is now possible to remotely query and set sensors options.
	
	- Make the plugin API allow different instance of one plugin to be loaded.

	- Allow recursive configuration file inclusion.

	- You can now define filesystem quota for failover.

	- Changed the way AND of manager work:
	  When using {{ manager_addr = x.x.x.x && y.y.y.y }}, the emission used to stop if emission to x.x.x.x failed. 
	  However, from a practical point of view, people who use AND of manager for redondancy want both manager to 
  	  receive exactly the same messages, even if one of the Manager fail.

	  Thus, in case emission x.x.x.x fail, we still want to emit the message to y.y.y.y, 
	  and save the failed message associating them to x.x.x.x manager, for later emission.

	- Heartbeat now carry a status and an interval.

	- Use GnuLib for enhenced portability.
	

* 2003-12-09, libprelude-0.8.10:

	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>:
	  use a newer libtool version (fix an OpenBSD) problem.

* 2003-12-05, libprelude-0.8.9:

	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>:
	  Use version-info to set library soname to something
	  meaningful. 

	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>:
	  Implement prelude_io_pending() function that return
	  wether there are byte waiting to be read or not. Take
	  care of the OpenSSL internal buffer.

	- Nicolas Delon <delon.nicolas@wanadoo.fr>:
	  Add a new prelude-io type dedicated to socket operation. 
	  Enable checking of connection state with theses. This fix
	  a bug where a connection breakage would only be noticed
	  on the second alert send.

	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>:
	  Make sensor-adduser work if not called by root.

	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>:
	  Allow sensor-adduser to be called without the --uid 
          option, but print a big warning telling that sensor added without
          a provided UID will have to be run using the registration UID.

	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>:
	  Set generated certificate to start being valid one day 
	  before of the current time. This can avoid problem in case 
	  one of the machine involved in the communication doesn't have it's 
	  time set right.

	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>:
	  Allow a children option to access it's parent option through
	  a new function in the prelude-getopt API.

	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>:

	  Fix a memory leak affecting prelude-lml.

	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>:
	  Fix a bug that could result in linking to the wrong 
	  version of libprelude being linked when dual libprelude 
	  version were installed.

	- Stephane Loeuillet <stephane.loeuillet@tiscali.fr>:
	  README update.

* 2003-09-30, libprelude-0.8.7:

	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>
	  Fix a crash on system without getaddrinfo().

* 2003-09-21, libprelude-0.8.6:

	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>
	  Re-establish post 0.8.5 behavior of defaulting to enable
	  asynchronous timer.

        - Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>
          Handle tool, overflow, and correlation alert.

	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>
	  Make the operation of gathering/executing a timer atomic. 
	  Merge part of the HEAD code and avoid locking in case
	  asynchronous timer aren't used.

        - Krzysztof Zaraska <kzaraska@student.uci.agh.edu.pl>
	  Add AC_PROG_CPP so the preprocessor is detected before the OpenSSL
	  presence test, so the OpenSSL detection works correctly.

	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>
	  Use pthread_join() instead of pthread_cancel().
	  The behavior of pthread_cancel too much depend on the architecture.

	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>
	  Add a --pthread-cflags option to libprelude-config in order to
	  avoid non threaded program to compile with pthread related option
	  which might slow down program execution due to extra locking used
	  by libc.

	- Sylvain Gil <prelude-code@tootella.org>
	  Fix libprelude compilation under MacOSX.

	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>
	  Forbid multiline comment. (Fix #0000078).

	  Fix GCC strict-aliasing warning.

	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>
	  Provide the ability for a prelude-client to connect using both
	  IPv4 and IPv6. Also, the prelude-client code has been reworked 
	  so that connection using UNIX and TCP socket share more code.

	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>
	  Implementation of the prelude_inet API providing IPv4/IPv6 lookup
	  function, as well as their fallback if IPv6 support is not present.

	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>
	  Explicitly permit linking with OpenSSL so that Debian
	  package might be distributed.

	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>
	  Fix AC_DATATYPE_GENERIC so that it can find valid socklen_t
	  replacement.

	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>
	  Fix a possible SIGSEGV on client that doesn't use prelude-getopt.

	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>
	  Fix a priority problem when assigning a variable, that
	  could lead to a SIGSEGV.

	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>
	  Fix compilation with OpenSSL 0.9.7.

	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>

	  a possible sensor-adduser SIGSEGV.
